# Voting errors

From http://research.un.org/c.php?g=98268&p=636558:

<blockquote>
The information provided comes from the voting machine in the General Assembly 
Hall. If a Member State informs the Secretariat of an error in the vote, the 
data is not changed and the vote must therefore be researched in the meeting 
records.
